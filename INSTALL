These dotfiles are managed by GNU Stow. Configuration files are stored in
different directories, each representing a separate application, or a component
of the system.

First, clone the most recent branch of this repository, along with the Git
submodules:

	$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/haiksgit/dots.git

Then, run GNU Stow to create symlinks for neccessary applications or components:

	$ stow -t ~/ <components>

Files that are not owned by GNU Stow will not be touched. The -D flag will
uninstall the components instead.

See stow(8) for more detailed instructions on how to use GNU stow.
